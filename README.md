# Built with Minimal Gridsome Starter with TailwindCSS + Markdown

[This starter is very simple](https://gridsome.org/starters/gridsome-tailwind-css-and-markdown-starter/):

> it's just meant to skip the setup of Gridsome as a Static Site + CMS. It's using TailwindCSS, as well as Markdown for the site content.

There are posts in the `content/posts` folder.

## Installation

### Install the Gridsome CLI

`npm i -g @gridsome/cli`

### Clone this Gridsome Project & Start the Development Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/watthem/matthewhendricks.net.git
cd matthewhendricks.net
npm install
gridsome develop
```
