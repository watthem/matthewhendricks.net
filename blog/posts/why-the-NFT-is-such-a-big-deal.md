At a point in my life (early 2021), when I heard people talking about “fungibility” my immediate response was an eye-roll accompanied with a yawn and the realization that my time spent on junk like this was also invaluable.

By now you have probably read plenty of headlines and pundit takes: when you look past the cartoon memes and volatility of cryptocurrencies, you’ll see there are practical applications for these nifty little contraptions. And soon, many believe these standards will define more than AI arranged pixels.

But every time I come across conversations about NFTs on the internet, I feel like we’re still talking about this in a very fixed mindset. So I wanted to add my take to the conversation, because I’m interested to see what others are thinking about these issues too.

The NFT platform allows innovative assignment and storage of all kinds of new concepts. So let’s explore a few real-world NFT applications with nothing to do with right-click-savings.

These use cases go beyond the storage of art and into areas of implementing non-digital concepts and enforcing their property rights on the internet. Many networks could implement these systems — many forms of these projects already exist.

## Not the pixels, but the policy

Under the hood, an NFT is a contract implementing a transfer of ownership and arbitrary valuation.

This is altogether an abstraction of the gold standard.

The general principle of the gold-standard was for giving governments a way to exchange fixed amounts of their local economy into a commodity. This monetary policy stimulates economic-based production when its value rises and discourages similar production activity when its value falls.

The same application applies crypto, their liquidity pools, and ultimately to NFTs.

### How can we define these concepts on a blockchain?

And why use a blockchain for social honor concepts at all?

Let’s clear something up right away. An NFT is not a picture. An NFT isn't a piece of music or currency. Nor is it a “receipt” or acknowledgment, as it’s so cleverly referred. It’s a [tokenized (data secure)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_%28data_security%29) agreement. And in today’s cryptocurrencies, we know it as a smart contract. But not only any smart contract; an NFT is typically a variation of the ERC-721 smart contract the defines the specific events and functionality, making it globally unique in a way so that within the contract we can:

- assign anyone ownership
- describe its contents as unique

So, what can meet an ERC-721 definition?

Before ERC-721, our valued-based agreements were limited the exchange of correlative measures by assets like precious metals, foreign currencies, or the price of food.

But the birth of the web gave us a new way to describe everything that is included in our economy and more. And history of Web 2.0 is precisely what makes Web 3.0 on beyond so incredible to be witnessing.

Now, thanks to these simultaneous digital revolutions, frankly, immutability on the blockchain (being able to store and prove something is unaltered) opens a world where we could make a global digital description of almost anything!

The magic is that we can now take objects or "things" off-chain, like you see with both digital and non-digital art alike, and we can digitize a description of this "thing" in a way that is immutable. This gives us a piece of code that lets us do things like assign value or transfer ownership or give voting rights.

If we can extrapolate data that describes a specific piece of property, content, or a piece of data, we can then describe ownership and keep a ledger of who keeps this information — in a way that is nearly impossible to dispute.

Since we can keep a digital record of all the meta information describes the contents, we can attach it to smart contracts. This gives us an unbiased observation of the transaction that can also be validated and documented by a 3rd party. Automatically.

With this recent change in technology, we can take certain structures that exist in society and values that need to be upheld and we can validate them through mechanisms of crowd-sourcing.

If you add the NFT value proposition back into industries like the gig economy, we automatically shift power back in the hands of people to allow them to take part in a tangible system of consequence.

This same system is not impractical, [it’s already US Law](/blog/what-is-a-wyoming-dao/).

## A social-driven collective

So how does a NFT help the economy and workforce?

Perhaps they got carried away with [The DAO](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#:~:text=The%20DAO%20was%20a%20decentralized,vulnerabilities%20in%20its%20code%20base.). But now, through things like **The Wyoming Decentralized Autonomous Organization Supplement** or **Vermont Limited Liability Company Act**, we have practical approaches to help legitimize and start such systems.

They did not set up the gold standard to be completely rational, but to become more comprehensive as it grows. And we see the same sort of agility in the defi’s governance techno-revolution.

Despite the misnomer, a DAO is not a robot; it is a collective of human intention. And it’s the only tool we have today to help solve our many crises. And it’s time to reason with it and get it working for us.

We have already seen tools, metrics and processes born out of the gig economy explode — especially with the rise of freelance becoming so attractive, even Microsoft/LinkedIn’s news about launching a marketplace hard to ignore.

But in my experience, they usually built these methods solely for the benefit and optimization of the for-profit companies that run them.

I believe we can take some of these concepts we’ve seen in the industry like car sharing, online freelancing, and other B2B contracting agencies for W2 and 1099 based knowledge-workers and make a techno-economy work more favorably for everyone involved.

It would not be too far-fetched from today’s models to implement fair and transparent AI inspired techniques like a universal query engine that can factor in industry agreement upon milestone measurements that are paired with stake/ownership. Or process discovery through a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) process models to help plan, rationalize, and integrate both organizational and individual worker goals.

No matter the system used, by matching previously documented work activities, a knowledge graph gives us specific data about previously experienced situations to help the economy revise products and reuse them for solving additional problems identified in new situations. This allows for incremental processes and inventory development that can be recalled, sustained, revised, and kept for future problems. We can anonymize and circulate this information through automated market makers providing companies more data back into the economy to help us learn from each other. In public, like we always did, before we decided our time was so valuable.

The difference between using exiting current corporate vendors versus using these ideas coming from blockchain protocol is that we will no longer need to be at the mercy of any authority (think Ticketmaster vs your favorite local venue).

Local participants could create small “liquidity pools” for individuals and supporters alike that would help translate value, stake, and rewards directly to the participants.

Instead of relying on one party to just “trust us” we start a trust-less model where everyone can take part and the market. And yeah, I know that is probably beyond what you’re thinking about when I used the word NFT, but this is happening whether you see it as a problem. Alternative forms of digital rewards are an untapped market and vacuum filling fast. Jpegs are just the start, sporting event tickets are just the signal of mass adoption, and insanely high APY could just be the benefit of the early adopters.

## The breadth of social property rights

None of these concepts are new.

So while some are calling this a revolution, in reality, it’s just the next step of our social-economic system. No one ever claimed the gold standard was perfect — it became more rational as it became more comprehensive.

By the year 2021, when you buy a piece of gold, you’re not buying the gold itself. You are publicly signaling your commitment to the value of the gold.

The same is true for any NFT, regardless of the underlying fractional asset. It’s a leap of faith that we expect others to value it later. The question always urges, ‘_it’s not backed by anything at all_’ — except for the policy.

### But we should not underestimate the importance of the core advantages of secure international securities

And neither should we undermine the rational and secure policy of smart contracts.

From the start, we realized we needed this standard to automate the operation of the gold. Looking back 100 years, we find references to the important advantages of commodity reserves:

- **effective international acceptance** — removes the need to submit policy decisions to international authority
- **automatic economic policy** — provides predictable monetary value easing use for all parties
- **secure fractional mechanism** — protects changes in supply, either through value or in an agreed upon a system of practical application.

It is the same story on different scales.

## Social honor concept examples

There are use cases in the wild.

### A credit tokenization system

There are many practical ways a credit system can play out. But by far the most long-lasting example we can pull from the field of real-world DeFi based organizations is a Bio-based “Value Chains” for growing and sustaining Bio-economy system.

We can implement a system in a way that rewards participants for measuring and monitoring the environmental impact of certain economic activity. Imagine a system where there is a platform to trade “Carbon Tokens” to smart contracts or public wallets.

One thing to understand about the use of cryptocurrencies, if they enable the existence of peer-to-peer liquidity pools.

These pools serve as a look-up system for public keys that can be used for a variety of purposes.

This is just how a group of shareholders or an ecosystem of businesses might pool together money and vote the use of public funds and treasuries for various trusts.

We have many examples of “DAOs” (decentralized autonomous organizations) and other “LPs” (liquidity pools) on the blockchain, but when you put these smart contracts and tokenize the reserve into a tangible currency model, you see a pattern of trust that emerges: Generators, Consumers, and Validities.

This now gives us the following set of actors that take part in a bio-economic reserve system:

- Carbon Credit Generators — wind farms, solar operations, and other carbon neutral energy actors.

- Carbon Credit Consumers — carbon emitters, polluters, oil companies, soda bottle distributors, and such.

- Carbon Credit Validities — network “nodes” with incentive to parameterize, appropriate, or verify project’s truth and otherwise take part in additional regulatory activities.

If you can imagine this playbook: generators create the underlying reserve token, consumers purchase them through bond sales, and when validations prove that a consumer has appropriately used the carbon credit, consumers can exchange an NFT (in return of carbon dioxide mitigated or removed).

The economic policy and smart contracts can mint and destroy these NFTs to help ensure everyone works in favor of the goals of protocol, not the players.

The energy consumers could also use NFTs by offering them as stake as needed for various regulatory requirements, traded for other currencies through automated market makers, or stored in value. Attractive bonding policies can be made so that stake and yield compounds through a systematic rebase. This is a built in treasury policy designed to compound APY, which in trust earns investors and stakeholders additional return for simply holding the stake in the protocol.

This sort of thing isn’t just a dream coming from some [white paper](https://www.uwyo.edu/research/advancing-research-and-scholarship/a-blockchain-based-carbon-credit-ecosystem.pdf) (Go Pokes), it’s also the primary policy behind [Klima DAO](https://klimadao.medium.com/klima-dao-ecosystem-climbing-olympus-3f6b3944b4c5).

### Let’s get fractional: A data model for intellectual properties

Jpegs and mp3s are just the beginning.

We’re seeing non-digital assets become licensed on blockchain and we can now prove that those things are what they are (and who they belong to).

Think about owning a tomato seed. You plant this seed and then hook up to sensors and optimize the soil/water/air quality/temp and such to get that seed of tomato to grow, all the while storing all those analytics to some database. Farmers already try to do this. In the past, they’re using interchangeable labels that can barely prove themselves to the supply chain, let alone the consumers. NFTs help fix this. Because when you use blockchains and you mint NFTs from this data, the difference maker is that you now have an unbiased and automatic 3rd party that can’t mingle with underling policy.

In NFT land, the farmer can put all this data they collect into a database chain (i.e., public or private distributed ledger). Then you sell that tomato seed as an NFT, where another farmer can look up your proof-of-work, and also grow their same seed using the data from the original tomato. All while using the NFT data to ensure the crop grows and sells as specified by the license.

And just like we saw in the carbon credit system, larger farm operations could run validatory repositories that make attractive rewards for proving this work and the original farmer gets a verified cut of the sales from that distributor.

As a farm boy from Nebraska, to me, that sounds incredible. And not only is it not incredible, it’s already happening. We have projects that help solve distribution like [FutureFarm](https://blog.iota.org/using-the-tangle-for-smart-agriculture-the-iota-foundation-teams-up-with-future-farm-consortium-a9d1757e33c/) — which sounds like just another food based DeFi Tool, is in reality a full transparent directed acyclic graph of all the required regulatory input in the process from getting the grass to a glass of milk. _Got data?_

### Protect rights of workers through public collective bargaining and consensus

Our society needs unions more than ever. We have a rich history of collectives, co-ops and unions that have always been realized and then subsequently proven wrong or ineffective through processes of manual consensus and antiquated ledgers. But the underlying need exists in society. And I believe we need to accept the NFT to help solve these problems through mechanisms of:

- Fair and open composite bargaining for employee welfare and job security.
- Market driven concessionary dealings to help negotiate wages in return for job placement.
- Non-violent integrative bargaining for mutually resolving disputes and documenting beneficial agreements between interested disputants.
- Open government of distributive negotiation for allocation of fixed resources, such as liquidity funds, software licenses, patents, and other assets distributed between parties.
- Unbiased and inclusive productivity capacity planning for workforce management and corporate team milestones and analytics.

We have no choice but to use the tools we have today. It may not be a perfect solution, but it’s time to drop the implication that machines need to manage 100% of the DAO. Or that it should be fully autonomous. There’s a hybrid approach that rarely gets discussed and it’s time to look at how we can use this model to apply to the current worker’s rights violations epidemic happening across the world today. DAOs are just collectives and it helps to think of it as a cooperative.

## On the whole, in the right direction

The difficulties of coordination without this globally accepted standard are impossible to do fairly.

Otherwise, self-coordination policy decisions will end up sacrificing some amount of interest and, without standards, end up hurting individuals, as well as limiting forms of arbitration.

Economic leaders developed the gold standard, hoping the policy itself would become more rational. And as we’ve seen, it has become much more comprehensive.

Just like Bitcoin was an abstraction and evolution of the gold standard to digital currency, we now have seen another expansion in our breadth of internationally accepted “gold standards”.

Which many now argue technologists have abstracted these standards to another breakthrough by providing access to a store of value that we could never reach before: trust-less, non-digital property rights on a global scale.
